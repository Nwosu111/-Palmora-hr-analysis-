Palmora HR Analytics – Capstone Project  
By: Chidinma Victoria Nwosu

Project Overview:  
This HR project was part of my DSA Capstone. It focuses on analyzing gender balance, salary distribution, and performance bonuses at Palmora Group. I used Microsoft Excel to clean and analyze the data from employees across departments and regions.

Tools Used:  
- Microsoft Excel (data cleaning, pivot tables, charts, IF formulas)

Key Findings:  
- Gender was fairly balanced in most regions and departments.  
- Some salary differences exist between male and female employees.  
- Only about 31% of employees earn more than ₦90,000, so the company is not fully compliant with salary regulations.  
- Most employees earn between ₦70,000 and ₦110,000.  
- The total bonus payout was ₦2.2M and overall salary payout was ₦71.9M.
